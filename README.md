# TweetIt
Tweetit is a  "microblogging" system that allows you to send and receive short text-based posts called tweets. Tweetit users can follow other users. Users can create their own tweets.  If you follow someone you can see their tweets in your TweetIt "timeline". Users can choose whom to follow and unfollow. 

TweetIt uses Back4app as BaaS so you have to create your acount at back4app first and then create your app there to get back4app_app_id & back4app_client_key and replace them with xxxxxxxxxx in app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml file.
